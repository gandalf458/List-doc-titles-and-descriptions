# List-doc-titles-and-descriptions

This is a simple PHP script to list the document titles and meta descriptions for a set of web pages (most likely a complete website); it also identifies any duplicate titles and descriptions. The purpose of the script is to help developers identify any pages with missing, incomplete or duplicate titles and/or meta descriptions.

The script is a single file named listmeta.php which contains all the HTML, PHP and CSS code.

The script requires a Yahoo!-style urllist.txt file listing the URLs to be processed. This should be placed in the same directory as the script itself, which may be a local directory. Several sitemap generators create a urllist.txt file as well as a Google sitemap.xml document.
