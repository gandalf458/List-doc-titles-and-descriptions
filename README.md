# List-doc-titles-and-descriptions

This is a simple (and possibly incomplete) PHP script to list the document titles and meta descriptions for a set of web pages (usually a complete website). Its aim is to help with website SEO by giving a visual view of the title and description of all indexable HTML documents in a website together with the length of each.

The script is a single file named listmeta.php which contains the necessary HTML, PHP and CSS code.

The script requires a Yahoo!-style urllist.txt file listing the URLs to be processed. Many sitemap generators will create a urllist.txt file as well as a Google sitemap.xml document.
